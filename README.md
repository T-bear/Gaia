# Gaia
a web aplication to display a greenhouse for the user.

The code is eddited to work with a Raspberry Pi 3, Flask and Python 2.7. We used Vis.js to show the nodes that is the different greenhouses that is connected to the database, MongoDB. 

Both Sensors.py and addSensor.py is needed to be located at the Raspberry Pi that has to be in a greenhouse where the sensors are.
The app.py is the server that is developed to send and receive data with APIÂ´s and display them on a webapplication and is not needed to be in a greenhouse.
